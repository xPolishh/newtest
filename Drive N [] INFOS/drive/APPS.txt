Folder "apps" is reserved for app files

How to add and launch apps?

- Normal apps
 Just move your app file to system32 folder, you dont have to move app data files
 Then in file opener tap "start (app name)"


- Batch etc apps
 In apps for example batch apps (most supported by system files) first (if your game
 require more than one file to work ,make (or if you have it already) new folder, place
 those files in it. Then make new shortcut to main file and place it (shortcut) in 
 system32. To launch it tap in file opener "start (your shortcut name here)"

Example is system built batch game Flappy Bird clone.
